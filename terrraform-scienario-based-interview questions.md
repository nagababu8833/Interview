Here are some scenario-based Terraform questions that you might encounter or use for practice:  

### Basic Scenarios:  
1. **State File Management**  
   - You have lost the Terraform state file for a deployed infrastructure. How would you recover it?  
   - What would happen if two developers tried to update the same state file simultaneously? How can you prevent conflicts?  

2. **Resource Changes**  
   - You updated a configuration for an EC2 instance, but after applying the changes, the instance is destroyed and recreated. Why did this happen? How can you avoid unnecessary resource recreation?  

3. **Variable Handling**  
   - A team member committed a `.tfvars` file with sensitive information to the repository. What steps would you take to resolve and prevent such issues in the future?  

4. **Modules**  
   - You need to deploy the same set of infrastructure for different environments (Dev, QA, Prod). How can Terraform modules help in this scenario?

### Intermediate Scenarios:  
5. **Terraform Backend**  
   - You need to share the state file across multiple team members. Which backend would you use, and why?  
   - What would you do if the backend service (e.g., S3 or Azure Blob) is unreachable during `terraform apply`?  

6. **Dynamic Blocks**  
   - How would you dynamically create multiple resources (e.g., subnets) in a loop using Terraform?  

7. **Provisioners**  
   - You want to run a script on a newly provisioned VM. What are the risks of using Terraform provisioners? Are there better alternatives?  

8. **Dependencies**  
   - A Terraform plan fails because the resource dependencies are not correctly defined. How would you fix this issue?

### Advanced Scenarios:  
9. **Drift Detection**  
   - A resource configuration in your Terraform script differs from the actual deployed resource. How would you detect and resolve this drift?  

10. **Multi-Cloud Deployments**  
   - Your organization wants to deploy infrastructure across AWS and Azure using Terraform. What challenges might you face, and how would you address them?  

11. **State File Locking**  
   - You notice that a Terraform state file is locked, preventing you from running `terraform apply`. How would you resolve this issue without causing state corruption?  

12. **Error Handling**  
   - During `terraform apply`, you encounter an error due to a resource limit (e.g., hitting the quota for EC2 instances). How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?  

13. **Workspace Usage**  
   - How would you use Terraform workspaces to manage environments (Dev/QA/Prod)? What are the limitations of using workspaces for this purpose?  

14. **Terraform with CI/CD**  
   - How would you integrate Terraform into a CI/CD pipeline? What steps would you take to ensure safe and automated deployment?  

15. **Custom Providers**  
   - Your organization uses an in-house cloud solution that doesnâ€™t have an official Terraform provider. How would you proceed with creating custom resources using Terraform?
